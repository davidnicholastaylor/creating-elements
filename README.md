# Practice creating elements featuring Tommy Wiseau

### Put an article DOM element in your index.html with the id attribute value of messages.

### In your JavaScript, use querySelector() to obtain a reference to that article DOM element.

### Create five (5) section elements, each with a class of message, and with textContent of your choosing.

### Using appendChild(), attach each message as a child to the messages element.
